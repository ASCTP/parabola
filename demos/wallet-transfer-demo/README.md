# wallet-transfer-demo

A minimal browser app demonstrating Parabola's non-custodial integration pattern: a visitor
connects their own MetaMask (Arc) and Freighter (Stellar) wallets and triggers a real transfer.
Nothing here holds a private key; every signature happens in the wallet extension.

This is also meant to be copied. `src/lib/` and `src/hooks/` are written to be liftable into
your own app with minimal changes. See [`../../INTEGRATION.md`](../../INTEGRATION.md) for the
two integration patterns this app illustrates (this one, plus the backend-held-key alternative).

## Live demo

[parabola-wallet-transfer-demo.vercel.app](https://parabola-wallet-transfer-demo.vercel.app/)

## Prerequisites

- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) (or another injected EVM wallet) browser extension
- [Freighter](https://freighter.app) browser extension
- Funded Arc and Stellar accounts. On testnet, get both via [faucet.circle.com](https://faucet.circle.com)

## Choosing a network

The app has a network selector at the top with two options: testnet and mainnet. Mainnet moves real USDC and spends real Arc gas on every transfer, so the banner turns red and says so; testnet uses faucet funds and moves no real money. Switching the selector disconnects both wallets, since an Arc signer is bound to one chain, and you reconnect on the network you chose.

The selector's initial value comes from `VITE_NETWORK`. It defaults to testnet when unset, so a fresh local checkout never starts on mainnet. Deployed builds intended for mainnet set `VITE_NETWORK=mainnet`.

```bash
VITE_NETWORK=mainnet   # deployed mainnet build; omit for a testnet-first local run
```

Point Freighter and MetaMask at the same network you select here before connecting.

## Running it

This app depends on `@asctp/parabola` via a pnpm workspace link (the package isn't published
yet), which means the SDK must be built once before the demo can resolve real types/JS:

```bash
# from the repo root
pnpm install
pnpm build       # builds @asctp/parabola's dist/, required before the demo will run
pnpm dev:wallet-transfer-demo     # starts this app
```

Then open the printed local URL, pick a network, connect both wallets, and try a transfer. Use
small amounts, and remember that mainnet moves real funds.

## What it demonstrates

- Building an `ArcSigner` from an injected EVM wallet (`src/lib/arcWallet.ts`): just a viem
  `WalletClient`, nothing Parabola-specific.
- Building a `StellarSigner` from Freighter (`src/lib/stellarWallet.ts`) via the
  `signTransaction` callback, rather than a raw `Keypair`.
- The single-call path: both wallets connected, `options.destinationSigner` attached, one
  `transfer()` call goes all the way to `status: "success"`.
- The two-step path (turn off "Complete the mint automatically"): `transfer()` returns
  `status: "pending"`, and a "Complete mint" button calls `completeMint()` separately once the
  destination wallet is connected.
- Honest error handling: if a transfer throws after the burn already succeeded, `transfer()`
  rethrows a `TransferError` carrying `burnTxHash`, so the error banner offers a "Complete mint"
  button instead of just telling the user to go find the hash themselves. A separate
  `SubmissionTimeoutError` covers a broadcast transaction whose confirmation timed out uncertain
  rather than failed. See `src/hooks/useTransfer.ts`, `src/components/ErrorBanner.tsx`, and
  `../../src/errors.ts`.

## Verification status

All four transfer paths (Arc→Stellar and Stellar→Arc, both standard and fast speed) have been
run end-to-end through this UI with real MetaMask and Freighter wallets against live Arc and
Stellar testnet. That live testing surfaced and fixed several real bugs beyond what typecheck and
`../../scripts/testnet-smoke.mjs` alone would have caught, including an RPC read-after-write race
in the Stellar burn path and a Vercel-specific build ordering issue; see the repo's commit history
for specifics.
